The [Quality Patches Tool](https://github.com/magento/quality-patches) delivers individual patches developed by Adobe and the {{ site.data.var.ce }} community. It allows you to apply, revert, and view general information about all individual patches that are available for the installed version of {{ site.data.var.ee }} or {{ site.data.var.ce }}. You can apply patches to {{site.data.var.ee}} and {{site.data.var.ce}} projects regardless of who developed the patch. For example, you can apply a patch developed by the community to {{site.data.var.ee}} projects.
