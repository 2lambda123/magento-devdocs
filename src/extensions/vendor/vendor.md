Vendor Bundled Extensions (VBEs) are third-party extensions that we have thoroughly tested and included with each supported version of {{site.data.var.ce}} and {{site.data.var.ee}}.

Current VBEs include:

-  [Amazon Pay]({{ site.user_guide_url }}/payment/amazon-pay.html)
-  [dotdigital]({{ site.user_guide_url }}/marketing/engagement-cloud.html) (formerly Dotmailer)
-  [Klarna]({{ site.user_guide_url }}/payment/klarna.html)
-  [Vertex]({{ site.user_guide_url }}/tax/vertex.html)
-  [Yotpo]({{ site.user_guide_url }}/marketing/yotpo-reviews-intro.html)
-  [Braintree]({{ site.user_guide_url }}/payment/braintree.html) (formerly part of core Magento)

{:.bs-callout-info}
Installing or upgrading Magento also installs VBEs, but you may need to set up an account with a vendor to configure and use an extension.

## Compatibility

The following table shows VBE version compatibility with Magento:
