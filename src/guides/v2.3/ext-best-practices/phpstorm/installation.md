Or alternatively, you can look for it and install it directly on your PHP Storm through `Preferences -> Plugins`.

In any case, after installing it you will need to enable the integration with Magento through `Preferences -> Frameworks`.

To do so, you have to check the `Enable Magento Integration` as it indicated [here](https://github.com/magento/magento2-phpstorm-plugin#installation).

Apart from this, you are also asked for:

- Magento installation path
- Adobe Commerce version (i.e., `2.4.1`)
- Default license name for new modules (by default, `Proprietary`)
