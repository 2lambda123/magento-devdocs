title: Adobe Commerce 2.3.7-p2 Release Notes
---

{{ site.data.var.ee }} 2.3.7-p2 is a security-only release that provides security fixes that enhance your Magento 2.3.7 deployment. Merchants can now install time-sensitive security fixes without applying the hundreds of functional fixes and enhancements that a full quarterly release provides. Patch 2.3.7-p2 is a security-only patch that provides fixes for vulnerabilities that have been identified in our previous quarterly release, {{ site.data.var.ee }} 2.3.7 and {{ site.data.var.ce }} 2.3.7.

PHP 7.3 reaches end of support in December 2021, and Adobe Commerce 2.3.x reaches end of support in April 2022. **We strongly recommend planning your upgrade now to Adobe Commerce 2.4.x or Magento Open Source 2.4.x and PHP 7.4.x to help maintain PCI compliance**.

Quarterly releases may contain backward-incompatible changes (BIC). {{ site.data.var.ee }} 2.4.3 contains minor backward-incompatible changes. To review minor backward-incompatible changes, see [BIC reference]({{page.baseurl}}/release-notes/backward-incompatible-changes/reference.html). (Major backward-incompatible issues are described in [BIC highlights]({{page.baseurl}}/release-notes/backward-incompatible-changes/index.html). Not all releases introduce major BICs.)

## What's in this release?

Six security fixes and several security enhancements are included in this security patch.  Security fixes are documented in the Adobe Security Bulletin.

Security-only patches typically include all hotfixes that have been released for the preceding complete release. This release incorporates the two hotfixes that have been released for {{ site.data.var.ee }} 2.3.7-p1 and {{ site.data.var.ce }} 2.3.7-p1. See [Adobe Commerce 2.3.7-p1 Release Notes]({{page.baseurl}}/release-notes/2-3-7-p1.html) for information about these hotfixes.

This release also includes bug fixes for the [Klarna](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/v2.3/payment/klarna.html) and [Vertex](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/v2.3/tax/vertex.html) vendor-developed extensions.

### Security highlights

**Session IDs have been removed from the database**. This code change may result in breaking changes if merchants have customizations or installed extensions that use the raw session IDs stored in the database. <!--- MC-40976-->

**Restricted admin access to Media Gallery folders**. Default Media Gallery permissions now allow only directory operations (view, upload, delete, and create) that are explicitly allowed by configuration. Admin users can no longer access media assets through the Media Gallery that were uploaded outside of the `catalog/category` or `wysiwyg` directories. Administrators who want to access media assets must move them to an explicitly allowed folder or adjust their configuration settings. See [Modify Media Library folder permissions]({{page.baseurl}}/ext-best-practices/tutorials/modify-image-library-permissions/). <!--- B2B-1897-->

**Lowered limits to GraphQL query complexity**. The GraphQL maximum allowed query complexity has been lowered to prevent Denial-of-Service (DOS) attacks. See [GraphQL security configuration]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/security-configuration.html). <!--- PWA-1700-->

**Recent penetration test vulnerabilities** have been fixed in this release. <!--- MC-42431-->

## Known issue

**Issue**: Adobe stock images uploaded into the `pub/media` and `pub/media/catalog` filesystem directories are not visible in the Media Gallery. **Workaround**: To view and work with these images, delete them from the filesystem directories and re-upload them into an allowed Media Gallery directory. See the [Stock images not displayed, Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source 2.3.7-p2](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409491698189) Knowledge Base article.
