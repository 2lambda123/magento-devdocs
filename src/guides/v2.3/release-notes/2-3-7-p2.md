title: Adobe Commerce 2.3.7-p2 Release Notes
---

{{ site.data.var.ee }} 2.3.7-p2 is a security-only release that provides security fixes that enhance your Magento 2.3.7 deployment. Merchants can now install time-sensitive security fixes without applying the hundreds of functional fixes and enhancements that a full quarterly release provides. Patch 2.3.7-p2 is a security-only patch that provides fixes for vulnerabilities that have been identified in our previous quarterly release, {{ site.data.var.ee }} 2.3.7 and {{ site.data.var.ce }} 2.3.7.

PHP 7.3 reaches end of support in December 2021, and Adobe Commerce 2.3.x reaches end of support in April 2022. **We strongly recommend planning your upgrade now to Adobe Commerce 2.4.x or Magento Open Source 2.4.x and PHP 7.4.x to help maintain PCI compliance**.

## What's in this release?

Five security fixes and four security enhancements are included in this security patch.  Security fixes are documented in [Adobe Security Bulletin](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/magento/apsb21-64.html).

Security-only patches typically include all hotfixes that have been released for the preceding complete release. However, no hot fixes have been released for {{ site.data.var.ee }} 2.3.7 and {{ site.data.var.ce }} 2.3.7.

### Additional enhancements

**Recent penetration tests identified the following vulnerabilities** that are fixed in this release: (MC-42431)

*  Validation of custom variables that used by administrators inside WYSIWYG fields has been added to prevent it from containing dangerous HTML tags and attributes

*  Stored cross-site scripting (XSS() vulnerabilities in customer segment reports have been removed

**Session IDs have been removed from the database**.  This removal prevents attackers with read access to the database from extracting session IDs.  (MC-40976)

**New directories in `pub/media` are no longer synced with local file systems** from S3 Remote Storage. Media gallery permissions now allow only directory operations (view, upload, delete, and create) that are explicitly allowed by configuration.  (B2B-1897)

**Configurable limits to query complexity**. Limiting query complexity  helps prevent attackers from creating distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks by overloading the server with specious requests. See [GraphQL security configuration](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/graphql/security-configuration.html)   (PWA-2000)
