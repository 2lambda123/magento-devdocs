Best practices for several issues within the PHPStorm Plugin.

### Issue reporting

Implemented extension point for errorHandler to integrate plugin with the IDE's dialog to report fatal errors.

#### Usage

*  When an issue occurred click on the `See details and submit report` link for reporting an issue.

*  Fill the issue description and click on the `Report Me` button:

*  Change the auto generated issue title to the proper one:
