title: Adobe Commerce 2.4.3-p1 Release Notes
---

{{ site.data.var.ee }} 2.4.3-p1 is a security-only release that provides 18 security fixes that enhance your Magento 2.4.3 deployment. Merchants can now install time-sensitive security fixes without applying the hundreds of functional fixes and enhancements that a full quarterly release provides. Patch 2.4.3-p1 provides fixes for vulnerabilities that have been identified in our previous quarterly release, {{ site.data.var.ee }} 2.4.3 and {{ site.data.var.ce }} 2.4.3.

Quarterly releases may contain backward-incompatible changes (BIC). {{ site.data.var.ee }} 2.4.3 contains minor backward-incompatible changes. To review minor backward-incompatible changes, see [BIC reference]({{page.baseurl}}/release-notes/backward-incompatible-changes/reference.html). (Major backward-incompatible issues are described in [BIC highlights]({{page.baseurl}}/release-notes/backward-incompatible-changes/index.html). Not all releases introduce major BICs.)
## What's in this release?

Five security fixes and several security enhancements are included in this security patch. Security fixes are documented in Adobe Security Bulletin.

Security-only patches typically include all hotfixes that have been released for the preceding complete release. This release incorporates the two hot fixes that have been released for {{ site.data.var.ee }} 2.4.3 and {{ site.data.var.ce }} 2.4.3.

This release also includes bug fixes for these vendor-developed extensions: [Braintree](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/payment/braintree.html), [Klarna](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/payment/klarna.html#changes-in-the-latest-release), and [Vertex](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/tax/vertex.html#changes-in-the-latest-release).

### Security highlights

**Session IDs have been removed from the database**.  This code change may result in breaking changes if merchants have installed extensions that store raw session IDs in the database.<!--- MC-40976-->

**New directories in `pub/media` are no longer synced with local file systems** from S3 Remote Storage. Default Media Gallery permissions now allow only directory operations (view, upload, delete, and create) that are explicitly allowed by configuration. See [Modify Media Library folder permissions]({{page.baseurl}}/ext-best-practices/tutorials/modify-image-library-permissions/). <!--- B2B-1897-->

**Configurable limits to GraphQL query complexity**. Merchants can now configure limits that restrict query complexity. See [GraphQL security configuration]({{page.baseurl}}/graphql/security-configuration.html). <!--- PWA-1700-->
