The Upgrade Compatibility Tool is a command-line tool that checks an Adobe Commerce customized instance against a specific version by analyzing all modules and core code installed in it. Returns a list of errors and warnings that must be addressed before upgrading to the latest version of Adobe Commerce. Identifies potential problems that must be fixed in your code before attempting to upgrade to a newer version of Adobe Commerce.

The Upgrade Compatibility Tool allows to identify when core code changes have been made to customized features. See the [Run the tool]({{site.baseurl}}/upgrade-compatibility-tool/run.html) topic for more information.

It is distributed as a Composer package with every release of an Adobe Commerce version. See the [Developer]({{site.baseurl}}/upgrade-compatibility-tool/developer.html) topic for more information.

Refer to the [Install]({{site.baseurl}}/upgrade-compatibility-tool/install.html) for the first steps with the Upgrade Compatibility Tool.
