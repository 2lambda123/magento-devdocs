The Storefront Events SKK provides access to a common data layer, and an event publishing and subscription service. The Storefront Event Collector package listens for events and sends them to Adobe Commerce for processing. For installation and quick start instructions, go to [Storefront Events SDK](https://devdocs.magento.com/shared-services/storefront-events-sdk.html).

The collector listens for the following search-related events:

-  `searchCategoryClick`
-  `searchRequestSent`
-  `searchResponseReceived`
-  `searchResultsView`
-  `searchSuggestionClick`
