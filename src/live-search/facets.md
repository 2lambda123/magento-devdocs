Faceting is a high-performance filtering method that uses multiple dimensions of static and dynamic attribute values as search criteria. The available facets appear in the left sidebar of search results pages, with the most commonly used facets “pinned” to the top of the list.

See [Facets](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/live-search/facets.html) in the _Magento Commerce User Guide_ for information about facet setup and use.

## Types of facets

There are two types of facets.

### Static

Price and Category are the only static facets and pinned to the top of the Filters list in the storefront. In addition, merchants can pin other commonly-used facets to the top of the list.

The filter values for Price are dynamically adjusted into price buckets that are distributed according to the number of products returned and rounded to the nearest $5.00. Unlike price navigation steps, price buckets overlap the next bucket by $1.00.

### Dynamic

Dynamic facets appear only when relevant, and the selection changes according to the products returned. In the storefront Filters list, dynamic facets appear in alphabetic order after any pinned facets. To streamline search results, facets are set to `dynamic` by default.

Intelligent dynamic facets measure the frequency that an attribute appears in the results list and its prevalence throughout the catalog. Live Search uses this information to determine the order of returned products. This makes it possible to return two types of dynamic facets: Those that are most significant, followed by those that are most popular.

## Facet type examples

A search of the Luma catalog for “bag” returns the following facet types:

```text
"type": "PINNED"
"type": "INTELLIGENT"
"type": "POPULAR"
```
### Example query

```text
query {query {
   productSearch(
      phrase: "bag",
      page_size: 100,
      sort: [{attribute: "price", direction: DESC}]  )   {
         total_count
         facets {
            title
            attribute
            type }
         suggestions
         page_info {
            current_page
            page_size
            total_pages  }
         }
      }
```

### Example response

        "total_pages": 1
      }
    }
  },
  "status": 200
}
```

## Dynamic facet examples

API calls generate both `terms` and `significantTerms` aggregations for all defined facets. For each facet, a field indicates whether it was generated by a `terms` or `significantTerms` aggregation:

```text
"type": "significant"
"type": "frequent"
```

In the query results, all `significantTerms` appear first ordered by most significant, followed by all terms ordered by most popular.

### Configured facets in Admin

```text
category: always displayed, 2
price: always displayed, 1
color
activity
brand
size
```

### Significant terms order

```text
color: 1
category: 2
activity: 3
brand: 4
```
