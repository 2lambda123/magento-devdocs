title: Buying Subscription-based Extensions
---

Starting December 2021, Adobe Commerce Marketplace provides extension vendors an opportunity to sell their extensions under an auto-renewing subscription model.

## Subscribing to an extension
Subscription extensions can be identified by pricing displaying price per period.

During checkout, subscription extensions will display the recurring amount that you will be charged.
Note: at this moment, Adobe Commerce Marketplace only supports annual extension subscriptions.

## Handling an extension license or pricing change
While flat fee extensions are fully licensed in perpetuity, subscription extension license only makes you eligible for support, notifications, and other services provided by the vendor while the subscription is active.
Vendors cannot turn a flat fee extension into an auto-renewable subscription.
Instead, vendors can elect to "sunset" the existing extension and replace it with an extension sold under a subscription license. They will do that by removing the extension from the store, which will trigger an email notification for all customers who licensed the extension in the past.
Vendors can change the price on a subscription extension while submitting a new version.
If you hold an active license to the extension, you will get an email notification explaining the pricing change.

## Managing your active subscriptions
Customers can check their subscriptions in the My Account section. In the list, the customer will see next payment date for each subscription. Merchant will have ability to add/edit various payment methods for every subscription extension. To update payment method go to My Profile → My Subscriptions → choose subscription which has to be updated → View and Edit and after that click on "Update payment method".

It is the buyer's responsibility to keep payment methods up-to-date. At least one payment method must be added. If payment method has not been added by the payment date, then the subscription will be cancelled.

## Canceling an extension subscription
Merchant can cancel their subscription at any time. To do so, go to My Profile→My Subscriptions→ choose subscription which has to be updated → View and Edit.  Change the Current Subscription Status to Cancelled.

To re-subscribe to a previously cancelled subscription, you will need to create a support ticket with Marketplace Support.

## Requesting a refund
A refund can be requested within 25 days of the initial purchase payment. Once the 25 day term expires, refund for the initial or any subsequent payments will not be possible.

## Re-subscribing to an extension
You can resubscribe to a cancelled extension subscription once. If you decide to cancel the subscription for the second time, you will not be able to re-subscribe to that SKU.
