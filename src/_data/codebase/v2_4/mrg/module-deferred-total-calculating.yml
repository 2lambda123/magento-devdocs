title: DeferredTotalCalculating
content: |-
  The Magento_DeferredTotalCalculating allows you to deffer total calculating until it requested, e.g. on cart page or final steps on checkout
  This functionality is optional and disabled by default.
  It could be enabled by setting *'checkout/deferred_total_calculating'* variable inside *env.php* file
  e.g.

  ```php
  <?php
        'checkout' => [
                 'deferred_total_calculating' => 1
         ]
  ```

  It can also be enabled through

  ```php
      bin/magento setup:config:set --deferred-total-calculating 1
  ```
